Cargo insurance protects a business from financial loss due to damaged or lost cargo. WealthGuard also offers Stock Throughput Policy (STP) options.

A Stock Throughput Policy is a marine policy that insures a companyâ€™s inventory and the flow of goods from the source of production to the final destination, whether to a place of storage or a retail store. Purchasing an STP rather than a separate transit and storage or property policy can provide more seamless coverage of goods, as well as more control of inventory risks throughout the entire supply chain.

100% underwritten by certain underwriters at Lloyd's.
