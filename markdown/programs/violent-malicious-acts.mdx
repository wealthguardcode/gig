A malicious attack that causes little or no physical damage may result in losses that will not be covered by property insurance. Liability insurance, terrorism, and WCA policies also may not respond. A malicious act insurance policy offers specialized protection to cover malicious incidents.

100% underwritten by certain underwriters at Lloyd's.

<br />
<br />

- Extra security personnel
- Temporary alternative premises & transportation
- Trauma counseling for staff
